# :sparkler: In the Shadows

In the Shadows is a simple Unreal Engine 3D puzzle game where player's task is to escape from dungeons. The game was inspired by Game.tv C++ Game development course tutorial. Assets for the game are from free Medieval Dungeon Asset Pack from Unreal engine Market place.

## The game currently includes:
- First level design
- Ability to grab (left mouse click) items and carry them around
- Pressure plate logic: When user set items in the area where trigger volume is added and weight of these items are heavy enough, action can be triggered (e.g. opening a door)
- Particle systems for fire elements in the game (fireplace, torches etc.)
- Ambient background music
- Door opening and closing animations
- Props placed in the environment that can be grabbed and carried

## Next steps:
- Improve lighting
- Add more levels
